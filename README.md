The summer season beginning from March extends almost till October, with some splashes of rains in between. However, the underlying warmness continues to remain year-round. Talking about hottest months, the duration from late May till mid-June records the highest temperature with mercury levels crossing 45Â° Celsius pretty often. Needless to say, that the scorching heat makes it nearly impossible to include Chennai as your summer vacation outing. However, the cool breeze of the sea, post sunset, offers some respite.</td>

Humidity levels go up substantially accompanied by moderate to heavy rains. Though few travel junkies do visit Chennai during monsoons, exploring the city amidst rainfall can get somewhat difficult.</td>

Winters in Chennai are very short-lived spanning from November to February with January recording the lowest temperature. Temperature during winters range between 14Â°C and 22Â°C. Chennai also receives occasional splashes of rain during winters, making the weather all the more pleasant. A tour of Chennai during winters can be highly enjoyed.</td>

<p>From lip-smacking street food and authentic Korean cuisine to exquisite sushi, the food scene in Chennai has gone global. In case youâ€™re one of those who believe that Chennaiâ€™s cuisine doesnâ€™t stretch beyond its â€˜idli-dosaâ€™ stereotypes, be prepared to be pleasantly surprised. Hereâ€™s the Chennai food guide that puts the spotlight on dishes that the city can really call its own even though some of them might not have necessarily originated here:</p>
