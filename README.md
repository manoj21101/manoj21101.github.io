The summer season beginning from March extends almost till October, with some splashes of rains in between. However, the underlying warmness continues to remain year-round. Talking about hottest months, the duration from late May till mid-June records the highest temperature with mercury levels crossing 45° Celsius pretty often. Needless to say, that the scorching heat makes it nearly impossible to include Chennai as your summer vacation outing. However, the cool breeze of the sea, post sunset, offers some respite.</td>

Humidity levels go up substantially accompanied by moderate to heavy rains. Though few travel junkies do visit Chennai during monsoons, exploring the city amidst rainfall can get somewhat difficult.</td>

<p>From lip-smacking street food and authentic Korean cuisine to exquisite sushi, the food scene in Chennai has gone global. In case you’re one of those who believe that Chennai’s cuisine doesn’t stretch beyond its ‘idli-dosa’ stereotypes, be prepared to be pleasantly surprised. Here’s the Chennai food guide that puts the spotlight on dishes that the city can really call its own even though some of them might not have necessarily originated here:</p>
<h3 style="margin-left:100px;text-align:left;font-size:25px;"> Filter Coffee<br></h3>

Almost all corners of the city boast high-quality coffee.</p>
